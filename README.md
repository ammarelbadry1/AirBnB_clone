# AirBnB Clone

This project is a clone of the popular vacation rental website, AirBnB. It aims to replicate the core functionality of the original website, including the ability to search for and book vacation rentals, as well as manage listings and reservations.

## Features

* Search for vacation rentals by location, date, and number of guests
* View detailed information about each rental, including photos, amenities, and reviews
* Book a rental and manage reservations through a user-friendly interface
* Create and manage listings for your own vacation rental properties

## Technologies Used

* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end
* Python and Flask for the back-end
* MySQL for the database

## Command Interpreter

This version of the project includes a command interpreter program called `console.py`. This program allows you to manipulate data without a visual interface. The available commands are:

* `quit` and `EOF` to exit the program
* `help` to show the available commands
* `help <command>` to print the documentation of this command
* `create <class-name>` to create an object of this class
* `show <class-name> <object-id>` to print the string representation of the object
* `destroy <class-name> <object-id>` to delete the object
* `all [<class-name>]` to print all string representation of all objects based or not on a class name
* `update <class-name> <object-id> <attribute-name> <attribute-value>` to update the object
